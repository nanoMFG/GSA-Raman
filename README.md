## Versioning

We use [SemVer](http://semver.org/) for versioning. For the versions available, see the [tags on this repository](https://github.com/your/project/tags).

[Bump2version](https://github.com/c4urself/bump2version) is used to increment the version and apply tags.  The basic setup follow tha guidlines illustrated [here](https://medium.com/@williamhayes/versioning-using-bumpversion-4d13c914e9b8).  All version bumps should happen on a clean working copy of the repository, after the last commit for that version has been pushed.  The push of the the `bump2version` changes will comprise the version.
